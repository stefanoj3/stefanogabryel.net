            <h2>2. Specific Disclaimer for Plant and Fungi Identification</h2>
            <p>
            The information, photos, and tips for identifying plants and fungi on this website are for educational purposes only and are not a substitute for expert advice.
            </p>

            <p>
            Many plants and mushrooms are highly poisonous, and some can be deadly. Misidentification can lead to severe illness or death. You must never consume a plant or mushroom based solely on information from this website, a book, or any other non-expert source.

            Always verify any identification with multiple, reliable sources and, most importantly, consult with an experienced mycologist or botanist. It is your responsibility to be 100% certain of an identification before touching or ingesting any wild plant or fungi. We accept no liability for any harm caused by the misidentification or consumption of plants or fungi based on the information provided on this website.
